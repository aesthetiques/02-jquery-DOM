## Stories Summary

* We began by reading through the code to understand what was going on, and what was doing what.
  * Due to the reading assignment being due today, I didn't read it until after this lab was completed.
  * With assistance from a TA, I was able to continue through to identify.
* We adjusted the constructor to include key:value pairs of the blogArticles.js, and paired that to what we'd be attempting to work with [with some guidance from an ever helpful TA again, here for the parameter/argument]
* Didn't realize that there were some issues with the scripts. And I finally actually read the html document. Found that scripts weren't in there. Made them. Things appeared.
* Made a picture rule in the base.css for img size.
* Final struggle was the names of the author appearing. Played with things until we pinned the ('element').text('insert-author-name-here'); to the right spot. This resolved all issues.
